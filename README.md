# Medi-Bot 3.1-8B

Medi-Bot 3.1-8B is a full-stack Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) medical chatbot. The backend was built using Python -- specifically Langchain, Ollama, Pinecone, and Flask -- while the frontend was constructed using React. Medi-Bot 3.1-8B uses Meta's Llama 3.1 8B model as its LLM backbone and a Pinecone vector database containing embeddings from *The Gale Encyclopedia o Medicine (2nd edition)* to power its RAG capabilities. The diagram below expands on how the app works.

**Please note: at this time, Medi-Bot 3.1-8B requires the user to have a GPU if they'd like to use the app locally. However, I am planning on deploying this app to AWS so anyone can use it via the Internet.**
